### Resources

In this project we used Numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas libraries to help us store it in a dataframe and explore the dataset. 

### Project Learning Objectives:

<ul>
<li> Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
<li> Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
<li> Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
<li> Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
<li> Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
<li> Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
<li> Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

<ul>
